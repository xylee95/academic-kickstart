abstract: Two-photon lithography (TPL) is an additive manufacturing technique for fabricating three-dimensional objects with nanoscale features. A main challenge of TPL is the routine and labor-intensive task of finding suitable light dosage parameters, i.e. writing speed and laser intensity that induce photo-polymerization within a wide variety of candidate photo-curing polymers. Another challenge is the monitoring required during fabrication. In this work, we apply machine learning (ML) models to accelerate the process of identifying optimal light dosage parameters and automate the detection of part quality. We curate TPL videos of different parts fabricated under a range of light dosage parameters using different resins and train spatial-temporal ML models on this data. Our results show that ML models can detect TPL part quality with a 95.1% accuracy in milliseconds. We also evaluate classification failures and identify two operating modes: parameter optimization and part quality detection. Last but not least, we publicly release this labelled dataset so that it may serve as a useful benchmark to the community. Our approach to process optimization and part quality detection addresses important aspects of TPL industrialization, is applicable beyond TPL and should benefit other additive manufacturing techniques with similar barriers to operating at industrial scale.



# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: The task of finding light dosage parameters for optimal printing conditions in two-photon lithography (an additive manufacturing technique) is often a routine and labor-intensive task. In this work, we applied a class of spatiotemporal deep learning model, specifically CNN-LSTM to automate the task of identifying optimal light dosage parameters. Incidentally, the same model can also be used for automated part quality monitoring during mass fabrication processes. The development of such models is important to help transform two-photon lithography from a niche laboratory technique into an industrialized technique.
